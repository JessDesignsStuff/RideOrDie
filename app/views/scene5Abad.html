        Declining the slime monster
      </h1>

      <p>You decline the slime monster as politely as possible. <br>As you and your animal companion turn to leave, the slime monster quickly eats them. <br> "Now you'll know what it's like to not have a friend." says the slime monster as he disappears into the bog. <br> What a horrible day.</p>
